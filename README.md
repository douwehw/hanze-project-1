## Hanze semester project 1

This is the repository for the codebase of the Hanze semester 1 project made by group 22.

We are making a portable airhockey-like game that can be played with two players. The game consists of the arena, a puck, two airhockey mallets & a few sensors to enchance the overal experience.

The goals will have both a weight sensor & ultrasonic distance sensor to detect if the puck has gone through the goal. If so, a series of LEDs attached to the arena will display the score.

Aside from the LEDs, there will also be a 7-segment display on the side of the arena which will display the duration of the match.

In this repository you can find all the source/header files that we run on the microcontroller inside the arena.
